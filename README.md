Following the 100 Days of Code (Python) challenge to immerse in language and gain knowledge as well as experience.

This project is of day 7, Hangman. Hangman is a word guessing game where the player guesses one letter at a time. A word is randomly chosen from the word bank and the player must guess what it is. For each incorrect guess, more of the man is drawn (represented by ASCI art). If the man is completely drawn being hung, the player loses.
